# LocalGov Income Management System

This is an open, collaborative local authority project funded by the Department for Levelling Up, Culture and Housing's (DLUCH) Local Digital Fund, and led by Barnsley Council & partners. We've been exploring the income management and ePayment systems in use across local government with a view to understanding how the current marketplace meets our needs and whether or not there's value and opportunity enough to share Barnsley's own IMS solution.

Barnsley's solution was developed as a replacement to their incumbent suppliers product, late 2018. Working together with their Finance team they launched a web based alternative that addressed a number of shortfalls and workarounds that they'd been wrangling with. It enabled a streamlining of their business processes that ultimately allowed them to redeploy 4 members of staff to other finance duties. Barnsley offered to share the IMS and a project began to see how possible that might be.

## Our project timeline:

* [Discovery Phase](https://localgovims.digital/discovery/) (Sep '19 to Jan '20): identifying council needs of their income management systems and marketplace gaps
* [Alpha Phase](https://localgovims.digital/alpha/) (Feb '20 to Sep '20): prototyping and testing solutions to those needs and gaps with councils
* [Beta Phase 1](https://localgovims.digital/beta/) (Jan '21 to present): developing those prototypes into an open source LocalGov variant of Barnsley IMS system
* Beta Phase 2 (coming soon): develop a commercial support offer around the open-source solution, working with the private sector

## Next steps

When the remaining functionality of Beta Phase 1 is ready, we'll be releasing the codebase right here on GitHub. The repository is currently private but will be made public. Right now we're identifying the best open-source license to share it under and we're setting up how we'll manage code contributions as and when updates are required. We're excited to have reached this point.
