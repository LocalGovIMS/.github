# The LocalGov Income Management System

The Local Gov IMS is an open source income management system built by local government for local government.

Itâ€™s intuitive, easy to maintain, enhance, and is free to use. It provides a comprehensive way to manage payments and accounting across council departments.

The system was built by local government teams who know about the needs, expectations, and challenges faced by similar organisations.

By engaging with other councils throughout its development, the system has been designed to reflect the needs of those who will use it.
